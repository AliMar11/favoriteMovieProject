# favoriteMovieProject


Welcome to Favorite Moivie Project!

This project is a way for me to practive some of the things I've leanred at a student of the Flatiron School! The project, thusfar, is composed of the following 4 views;

(1)MainView: A CollectionViewController where movie posters are displayed. Users can select a movie, browse by scrolling down, request more movie titles by clicking the 'more movies' footer and search for specific movies/shows/video games in the search bar. Here's a picture!

(2)MovieView: A UIViewController where popular movie details are displayed. This view is shown when a user selects a movie poster from the MainView ( aka when a user selects an item from the collection view). A user can request more information on a movie or favorite the current movie title. Below is a picture!
