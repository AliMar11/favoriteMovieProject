# favoriteMovieProject


Welcome to Favorite Moivie Project!

This project is a way for me to practive some of the things I've leanred at a student of the Flatiron School! The project, thusfar, is composed of the following 4 views;

(1)MainView: A CollectionViewController where movie posters are displayed. Users can select a movie, browse by scrolling down, request more movie titles by clicking the 'more movies' footer and search for specific movies/shows/video games in the search bar. A picture is coming soon!

(2)MovieView: A UIViewController where popular movie details are displayed. This view is shown when a user selects a movie poster from the MainView ( aka when a user selects an item from the collection view). A user can request more information on a movie or favorite the current movie title. A photo is coming soon!

(3)DetailMovieView: A UIViewController where even more information on a movie is displayed. A picture is coming soon! 

(4)Favorites: A UITableViewController where favoritedMovies are displayed. The items here are saved as coredata Objects (for prsistance). In this view a user can delete a single entry by swiping left or delete the entire collection. A picture is comming soon!
